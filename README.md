## Gameplay

When Pigs Fly is an adventure in which you jump and pick up power-up items to help you on your journey. You will guide Oinker to move across in a jumping/flying motion to the end of the game without touching the ground or get caught by the butcher. The player must keep the pig flying and dodge the buthcers knife from hitting the pig. Along the way you can get power ups to increase your odds of suervival as you traverse a city, a forest, and a canyon in order to escape and earn your freedom.

## Player Character

Oinker is a pig with wings. His expression is a scared and afraid expression due to the imminent fate that awaits him. His body is round and pink like a pigs should be, his wings are white-ish blue as depicted on tv. His powers include flight and bacon breath. The Flying is used to avoid obstacles like the butcher and whatever else gets in your way. 


## Enemy Character

The butcher is a man with a big knife. He is constantly chasing you and will not stop until you escape. A smiling expression is on his face due to the imminent feast that awaits him. His body is round and heavy as a typical butcher stereotype should be, he has a hat and apron to tie the whole thing together. His powers include knife throwing. The knife deals a lethal blow and if you get hit by it its game over.


## Power-Ups 

- Wings Up - Makes Oinkers jump doubled. This can be usefull but may also hinder you on your journey.  
- Quittin Time - The butcher will take a break and not throw knives at you. This allows you to use the bottom third of the map for 15 seconds.
- Bacon Bomb - A one shot bomb that can eliminate the butcher if you can land the hit. There is a high risk when using this
